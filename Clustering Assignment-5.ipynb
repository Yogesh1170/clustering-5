    "- Accuracy can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., if one class has significantly more samples than the other class. In this case, accuracy can be high even if the model is biased towards the majority class and performs poorly on the minority class. For example, if a dataset has 90% positive samples and 10% negative samples, and a model predicts all samples as positive, the accuracy will be 90%, but the model will fail to identify any negative samples .\n",
    "- Accuracy does not take into account the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, which can have different costs and consequences depending on the context of the problem. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, a false positive (predicting a disease when the patient is healthy) may cause unnecessary anxiety and treatment, while a false negative (predicting no disease when the patient is sick) may cause delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this case, accuracy alone may not reflect the true performance of the model .\n",

For example, in a multi-class classification task, a model may have high accuracy overall, but low accuracy for some specific classes. In this case, accuracy alone may not reveal the areas where the model needs improvement .\n",
